- Hi, I’m @jose-soural (he/him), a math student at Charles University in Prague. I wouldn't call myslef an experienced coder, but I'm trying my best :).
- I set up my github account for mainly school purposes, so keep that in mind.
- If (for some reason) you would like to reach me, the preferred way is by mail at soural.josef.2003@gmail.com
- Fun(?) fact: According to some sources, the only animal besides humans that can suffer from leprosy is the armadillo.
